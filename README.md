# Depth-First-Search-and-Breadth-First-Search
This was apart of my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence assignment. The task was to build a functioning DFS and BFS that can navigate a grid. 

The point of the exercise was to learn how these two uniformed searches move through trees.

It was a interesting assigment that I learned a lot from. I have fun trying to figure out how exactly it was working between the two.
